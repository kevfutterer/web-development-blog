		<h1>About DI Kevin Futterer</h1>
		<p>
			As an educated Physicist and experienced programmer I attach great
			importance to profound development and structured implementation of
			simulation models. My broad positioned field of knowledge for theoretical
			and practical application purposes for problem solving complements very
			well with my open and strong communication traits of my personality. I
			have great joy to express my feeling of aesthetics through appealing
			designs and layouts, as well as in different parts of my personal life.
			Besides my strong interest to develop myself, my engagement to learn
			something new and confront new challenges, I also have great pleasure to
			share my knowledge to others.
